# Accordion Block

An interactive accordion component for Franklin sites.

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Table in Google Docs

Create a 2-column table where:
- **Left column**: Contains the accordion header text (what users click to expand)
- **Right column**: Contains the accordion panel content (what gets revealed)

### 2. Table Structure Example

## Content Guidelines

### Headers (Left Column)
- Keep header text concise but descriptive
- Use questions, topics, or short phrases
- Avoid very long headers (they wrap but may look cluttered)

### Panel Content (Right Column)
- Can include rich content: text, images, lists, links
- Supports multiple paragraphs
- Images are automatically optimized for web
- Formatting from Google Docs is preserved

### Tips
- You can have as many rows (accordion items) as needed
- Additional columns beyond the first two are ignored
- Empty cells will create empty headers/panels (avoid this)
- Test on mobile to ensure content is readable
